WELCOME TO NGUYEN GIA THINH'S MINI SWAMP ECOSYSTEM (MSE)

Overview 
The Mini Swamp Ecosystem is an interactive simulation where you control a frog in a lively swamp environment.
This swamp is filled with flies, fish, cattails, a kingfisher, and natural elements like clouds and stars. 
The world features a dynamic day-night cycle and supports both manual and autoplay control modes. 
Players can jump, turn, and activate a special stinky mode to influence the ecosystem. 
The goal is to catch flies to earn points while navigating through the environment. 
An optional analysis mode provides insight into the behavior and interactions of the ecosystem's inhabitants. 
The ecosystem can be seeded for repeatable worlds or started with a random seed for unique experiences.

There **might** be a secret seed that you can find by completing an easter egg.
